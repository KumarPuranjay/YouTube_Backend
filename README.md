# YouTube_Backend

This entire project is taken from youtube channel "Chai Aur Code" from the series "Chai Aur Backend in JS"

## Note
- "/public/temp" folder is used to store images temporarily.
- ".gitkeep" is a file that is used to create that in the git project as git keeps a record of only files and not folders.

## Furture Scope
- Migrate it to from mongoose to prisma
- Docker it into a single image
- Add load balancing to it using nginx
